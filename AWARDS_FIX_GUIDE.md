# Awards Statistics Loading Error - Solutions

## üî¥ Problem
**Error Message:** "Failed to load nominations" or statistics showing 0/empty

## üîç Root Cause
Your backend API hosted on Render.com (free tier) **goes to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity**. When someone visits the Awards page after inactivity, the API requests fail because the backend needs 30-60 seconds to wake up.

## ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Better Loading States ‚úÖ
- Added loading indicators ("...") while data is being fetched
- Stats now show "..." instead of "0" during loading
- Added safety check for votes calculation (`nom.votes || 0`)

### 2. Improved Error Handling ‚úÖ
- Errors are now logged to console for debugging
- Network errors don't show alarming pop-ups
- Only real API errors show user alerts

## üöÄ Recommended Solutions

### Option A: Keep Backend Awake (Quick Fix)

**1. Use the Keep-Alive Service:**
Add this to your `src/main.jsx` or `src/App.jsx`:

```javascript
import { renderKeepAlive } from './services/keepAlive';

// Start the keep-alive service
renderKeepAlive.start();
```

**2. External Ping Service:**
Use a free service like:
- **UptimeRobot** (https://uptimerobot.com) - Free, pings every 5 minutes
- **Cron-job.org** (https://cron-job.org) - Free, custom intervals

Set it to ping: `https://sap-technologies-ug.onrender.com/api/health`

### Option B: Upgrade Render Plan (Best Long-term)
- Upgrade to Render's paid plan ($7/month)
- Your backend will never sleep
- Faster response times
- More reliable

### Option C: Migrate to Different Host
Consider these alternatives:
- **Railway** - Free tier doesn't sleep as much
- **Fly.io** - Better free tier
- **Vercel** - Host both frontend and backend serverless functions
- **AWS Lambda** - Serverless, pay per use

### Option D: Add Retry Logic (Best UX)

Update `loadNominations()` with retry:

```javascript
const loadNominations = async (retries = 3) => {
  try {
    setLoading(prev => ({ ...prev, nominations: true }));
    const params = new URLSearchParams({
      page: pagination.currentPage,
      limit: 12,
      sortBy,
      sortOrder: "desc"
    });

    if (selectedCategory) params.append("category", selectedCategory);
    if (filterCountry) params.append("country", filterCountry);
    if (searchTerm) params.append("search", searchTerm);

    const response = await apiService.get(`/awards/nominations?${params}`);
    setNominations(response.data.nominations);
    setPagination(response.data.pagination);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to load nominations:", error);
    
    // Retry if it's a network error and we have retries left
    if (retries > 0 && (error.message?.includes("Failed to fetch") || error.message?.includes("NetworkError"))) {
      console.log(`Retrying... (${retries} attempts left)`);
      setTimeout(() => loadNominations(retries - 1), 2000); // Wait 2 seconds before retry
      return;
    }
    
    // Only show error alert if all retries failed
    if (!error.message?.includes("Failed to fetch") && !error.message?.includes("NetworkError")) {
      showAlert.error("Error", "Failed to load nominations. Please try again.");
    }
  } finally {
    setLoading(prev => ({ ...prev, nominations: false }));
  }
};
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Test

### Check if Backend is Awake:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Run: 
   ```javascript
   fetch('https://sap-technologies-ug.onrender.com/api/health')
     .then(r => r.json())
     .then(console.log)
     .catch(console.error)
   ```

### Expected Results:
- **If awake:** Response in ~100-500ms
- **If sleeping:** Takes 30-60 seconds, then responds

## üìä Check Backend Health

Visit: https://sap-technologies-ug.onrender.com/api/health

**Healthy Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-14T..."
}
```

## üîß What Was Fixed

### Files Modified:
1. **Awards.jsx**
   - Added loading states to statistics display
   - Improved error handling (less alarming)
   - Added null safety for votes calculation

2. **keepAlive.js** (NEW)
   - Created service to keep backend awake
   - Pings every 10 minutes
   - Prevents Render from sleeping

## üí° Immediate Action Steps

1. **Test Backend Health:**
   - Visit: https://sap-technologies-ug.onrender.com/api/health
   - If it takes >10 seconds, backend was sleeping

2. **Set Up UptimeRobot (Recommended):**
   - Go to uptimerobot.com
   - Create free account
   - Add monitor: `https://sap-technologies-ug.onrender.com/api/health`
   - Set interval: 5 minutes
   - ‚úÖ Done! Backend will stay awake

3. **Or Use Keep-Alive Service:**
   - The code is already created in `src/services/keepAlive.js`
   - Just import and start it in your main.jsx

## üìà Monitoring

### Check if Solution Works:
1. Wait 20 minutes (let backend sleep if not using keep-alive)
2. Visit Awards page
3. Check browser console
4. Should see either:
   - Data loads successfully (if keep-alive working)
   - Loading indicators appear briefly (improved UX)

### Backend Logs:
Check Render dashboard:
- Go to render.com dashboard
- Click your service
- View logs
- Look for API requests

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### Render Free Tier Limitations:
- **Sleeps:** After 15 minutes inactivity
- **Wake time:** 30-60 seconds
- **Monthly hours:** Limited
- **Bandwidth:** 100GB/month

### Solutions:
1. **Short-term:** Use UptimeRobot (free, easy)
2. **Long-term:** Upgrade to paid plan ($7/mo)

**Current Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed with better error handling and loading states
**Recommended Next Step:** Set up UptimeRobot to keep backend awake
